📁 Project Structure Highlights
This project includes two key files that help map each project to its learning goals:
| File Name | Purpose | 
| skill.txt | Lists the core skills or concepts covered in each project. | 
| explanation.txt | Provides beginner-friendly explanations and context for each project. | 


These files are designed to support learners by:
- 🧠 Clarifying what you're learning and why it matters
- 🛠️ Connecting each project to real-world applications
- 🗺️ Helping mentors and educators track progress and guide learners

🔍 Example Mapping
Project: Week-1/TextAnalysis
skill.txt: "Basic string manipulation, file I/O, Unicode handling"
explanation.txt: "This project introduces text analysis using Python. Learners explore how to read files, clean text, and handle encoding errors like UnicodeEncodeError."
